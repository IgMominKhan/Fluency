## Lessons I have Learned

It was a challenge for me to build this application within a short time. There was nothing rather than just the idea of features. Though I am not a UI expert, I have designed the UI and developed a fully functional application within the deadline. During this project, I have learned how to complete tasks in a short time and how to think about UI. I want to add more features soon to complete the project.
